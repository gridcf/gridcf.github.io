Overview
========

The Grid Community Forum (GridCF) provides support for software that is core to the global grid community.

Specifically, the GridCF is attempting to support a software stack christened the [Grid Community Toolkit](http://gridcf.org/gct-docs/) (GCT).  The GCT is an open-source fork of the venerable [Globus Toolkit](http://toolkit.globus.org/toolkit/) created by the [Globus Alliance](http://toolkit.globus.org/alliance/).  The GCT is _derived_ from the Globus Tookit, but is not the Globus Toolkit.  Further, the GridCF is not a part of the Globus Alliance.

The GridCF is a nascent organization: we are looking for energetic contributors across a broad range of technical skills.  Check out our [governance doc](governance.md) and [join us on Github](https://github.com/gridcf)!

Objectives
----------

The creation of the GridCF and the GCT fork of the Globus Toolkit was motivated by the announcement of the upcoming [end-of-support](https://github.com/globus/globus-toolkit/blob/globus_6_branch/support-changes.md) of the Globus Toolkit in January 2018.

With this effort, we aim to:

- Maintain the quality and security of critical functionality such as the Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI) and an open-source GridFTP implementation.
- Partner across several grid organizations to share the burden of supporting this core functionality.
- Provide an open and welcoming forum for external contributors to improve the software.
